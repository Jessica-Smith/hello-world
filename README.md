# hello-world
This is a test repository.
The help guide told me to write about myself here...so here's a quick picture of me: my name is Jessica Smith and I am a 3rd year Geography student at Carleton University with a double minor in Geomatics and French. This is my first time using this website and I have minimal coding experience and no GitHub experience. Fingers crossed to a good time learning!
